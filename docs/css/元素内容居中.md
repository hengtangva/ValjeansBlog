# to make content align center in a block element

i make a box , and want to let the content in the center of the box         

in horizontal direction , just give a property 'text-align: center' will make sense        

but in vertical direction, i have to way to deal width it.        

i know ,i can use a box to wrap the content, and make it be in the center of the parent box       

yet it will cost quite a lot code        

so, i give the box one propery line-height = height        

as a result, the content is on center in vertical direction       

it remind me to review the property line-hieght
